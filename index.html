    <h2>About WaterFalls:</h2>
    <p>Waterfalls are areas where a river or stream reaches a drop off or cliff. The water keeps flowing, and it falls over the edge. Usually there is a lake or pond below that the water falls into. Waterfalls can be found all over the world, and they are often very popular tourist attractions</p>
    <h2>How WaterFalls are formed ?</h2>
    <p aligh="justify">Waterfalls are commonly formed in the upper course of a river where lakes flow into valleys in steep mountains.

        A river sometimes flows over a large step in the rocks that may have been formed by a fault line.<br> Waterfalls can occur along the edge of a glacial trough, where a stream or river flowing into a glacier continues to flow into a valley after the glacier has receded or melted. The large waterfalls in Yosemite Valley are examples of this phenomenon, which is referred to as a hanging valley. Another reason hanging valleys may form is where two rivers join and one is flowing faster than the other. </p>

        <h2>Types of WaterFalls</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt> Plunge Waterfalls:</dt><dd> Water falls directly downward, often with little to no contact with the rock face.<br></dd>
            <dt>Cascading Waterfalls:</dt><dd>Water flows over a series of steps or rocks, creating a tiered effect.<br></dd>
            <dt>Block Waterfalls:</dt><dd></dd> Water falls over a wide, flat rock face, creating a block-like appearance.<br></dd>
            <dt> Horsetail Waterfalls:<dt><dd> Water maintains some contact with the rock face, resembling a horse's tail.</dd>

            <p>Angel Falls is the world's highest uninterrupted waterfall. It cascades from the Auyán-tepui mountain, which is part of the Tepui plateau in Venezuela’s Gran Sabana region. The waterfall is named after Jimmy Angel, an American aviator who accidentally discovered it in 1933 while searching for a gold mine. The sight of the falls is particularly spectacular when the water is flowing heavily during the rainy season, creating a misty veil that can be seen from miles away.</p>

            <p>Victoria Falls is one of the most spectacular natural landmarks in the world. Located on the Zambezi River, which forms the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, it is one of the largest and most famous waterfalls globally.

            <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp7487703.jpg" alt="nature" width="40%">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DAavVzRbN8s?si=I5nLUc8oQJi7LnFO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>Yosemite Falls is a major attraction within the park, visible from many viewpoints and hiking trails. The best time to see it is typically in the spring and early summer when snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada peaks is at its peak, leading to a powerful flow of water. By late summer, the flow can diminish significantly, making it less dramatic but still beautiful. The waterfall's backdrop of granite cliffs, such as El Capitan and Half Dome, adds to its stunning natural beauty.</p>
